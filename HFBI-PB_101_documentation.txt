--- HFBI-PB 101 Documentation ---
To run:
Open the .circ file in Logisim
Set tick rate (Simulation) to 16hz
Activate Simulation Enabled (Simulation)
Activate Ticks Enabled (Simulation)
Set tool to prod
Use switches (pins) and button to control
Components:
1.  1-bit CPU for processing 
	(16hz/0.02khz, HFBI-PB 100)
2.  2 switches for input - one is 
	main command/opcode and one is argument/operand
	(in simulation, replaced with pins)
3.  2 1-bit registers for storing data 
	(in simulation, they are inside HFBI-PB 100)
4.  2 pixel monitor/display, 1-bit color depth, 
	connected to component 3 (in simulation, 
	replaced with a pair of lightbulbs and 
	connected to HFBI-PB 100 instead)
Commands:
Command 0 is "set the current focused register to the value specified 
by the argument"
Command 1 is "stop/start the updating of the part of the display 
connected to the current focused register, and if the argument is 1, 
after that switch the current focused register"
